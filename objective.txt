### Specific Objectives:
1. **Identify Fraudulent Transactions**: Detect and prevent fraudulent activities by analyzing real-time and historical transaction data.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Implement machine learning models to flag anomalies in transaction behavior that deviate from normal patterns.
3. **Reduce False Positives**: Minimize the number of legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraudulent by improving model accuracy.
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Ensure fraud detection is conducted in real-time to immediately flag and halt suspicious activities.
5. **Adaptive System**: Build a system that adapts to new and evolving fraud patterns by continuously learning from new data.
6. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provide detailed reports for flagged transactions, identifying trends, and reasons for classification as fraud.
